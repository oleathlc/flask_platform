How to use
============

To use this flask_platform application, you must first have installed the sysinfo module from github 
(url: https://github.com/oleathlc/sysinfo.git).

Once the module has been installed, open up an instance of the bash terminal. Then, navigate to the
src folder within the flask_platform directory, and then to the dummyapp repository. From here you
can run the flask app, using the commmand "$ ~/src/dummyapp/  python run.py. Now, open an internet 
browser and enter "localhost:5000" and the system information will be shown there.
